* **Virtual IP Management**: Built-in VIP management eliminates external load balancer requirements
* **Real-time Validation**: Continuous validation throughout the installation process

=== Assisted Installer: Cloud-guided Installation
**Best for**: Connected environments with web-based management preference

==== Key Characteristics
* **Interface**: link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/assisted-installer/clusters[Web-based console] with guided workflow
* **Environment**: Requires internet connectivity to Red Hat services
* **Automation**: Automated validation, real-time monitoring, and smart defaults
* **User Experience**: Intuitive UI suitable for all skill levels

==== Technical Features
* **Discovery Process**: Automatic hardware detection and validation
* **Network Configuration**: Simplified network setup with VIP management
* **Monitoring**: Real-time installation progress tracking
* **Validation**: Continuous pre-flight and installation checks

=== Agent-based Installer: Air-gapped Installation
**Best for**: Disconnected environments, custom configurations, and automation

==== Key Characteristics
* **Interface**: Declarative configuration files and command-line tools
* **Environment**: Supports fully air-gapped and disconnected deployments
* **Customization**: Complete control over all installation parameters
* **Automation**: Ideal for CI/CD integration and infrastructure-as-code

==== Technical Features
* **Configuration Files**: `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` for declarative setup
* **Mirror Registry**: Built-in support for disconnected image mirroring
* **Agent ISO**: Self-contained installation media with embedded configuration
* **Offline Operation**: Complete installation without internet connectivity
