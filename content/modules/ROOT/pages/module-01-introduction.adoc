== What is OpenShift 4.18/4.19? [[what-is-openshift]]

link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/architecture/architecture-overview[OpenShift Container Platform] is Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes platform that provides a complete application platform for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications.

=== Core Platform
* **Built on Kubernetes**: 1.31 (OpenShift 4.18) / 1.32 (OpenShift 4.19)
* **Operating System**: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/architecture/architecture-rhcos[Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)]
* **Enterprise Features**: Security, monitoring, networking, and storage integrated out-of-the-box
* **Developer Tools**: Built-in CI/CD, container registry, and development workflows

== Key Features & Benefits [[key-features]]

=== Why Choose OpenShift for Bare Metal?

==== Enterprise Security
* Built-in security scanning and compliance
* Pod security standards and network policies
* FIPS 140-2/140-3 cryptography support

==== Operational Efficiency
* Automated updates and lifecycle management
* Self-healing infrastructure
* Integrated monitoring and observability

==== Developer Productivity
* Multiple programming languages and frameworks
* Built-in container registry and build services
* Comprehensive API and CLI tools

==== Bare Metal Advantages
* Maximum performance with direct hardware access
* Full control over infrastructure and security
* Cost optimization for predictable workloads
* Compliance with data sovereignty requirements

== Installation Methods Overview [[installation-methods]]

OpenShift 4.18/4.19 provides multiple installation methods for bare metal deployments:

=== Assisted Installer (Recommended for Most Users)
* **Best for**: Connected environments with internet access
* **Interface**: Web-based console with guided workflow
* **Features**: Automated validation, real-time monitoring, smart defaults
* **Documentation**: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/installing_on-premise_with_assisted_installer/installing-on-prem-assisted[Assisted Installer Guide]

=== Agent-based Installer (For Advanced/Disconnected Environments)
* **Best for**: Air-gapped environments, custom configurations
* **Interface**: Configuration files and command-line tools
* **Features**: Full customization, disconnected support, automation-friendly
* **Documentation**: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/installing_an_on-premise_cluster_with_the_agent-based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[Agent-based Installer Guide]

=== Choosing Your Installation Method
You'll make this decision based on your environment:
* **Internet connectivity**: Assisted Installer requires internet access
* **Customization needs**: Agent-based provides more configuration options
* **Team expertise**: Assisted Installer is more user-friendly
* **Automation requirements**: Agent-based integrates better with CI/CD

== Workshop Structure [[workshop-structure]]

.Workshop Flow Overview
