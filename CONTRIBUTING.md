## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our content guidelines.

3. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add detailed networking configuration examples"
   ```

## Content Guidelines

### Document Structure
- Use AsciiDoc format for documentation (`.adoc` extension)
- Follow the existing module structure
- Include clear section headers with anchors
- Use consistent formatting

### Images
- Place images in the appropriate module folder under `content/modules/ROOT/assets/images/`
- Use meaningful file names
- Optimize images for web viewing
- Include alt text for accessibility

### Code Examples
- Include clear, well-documented code examples
- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Test all code examples before submitting

## Using Utility Scripts

The repository includes several utility scripts in the `utilities/` directory and a Makefile to help you build and test the documentation locally.

### Available Make Targets

```bash
make help        # Display help message
make serve       # Start the local server
make stop        # Stop the local server
make build       # Build the documentation
make clean       # Clean the build directory
make run-all     # Build and serve the documentation
make stop-clean  # Stop server and clean build directory
make clean-build # Clean and rebuild the documentation
```

### Utility Scripts

1. **lab-build**
   - Builds the documentation site using Antora
   - Creates output in the `./www` directory
   ```bash
   ./utilities/lab-build
   ```

2. **lab-serve**
   - Starts a local HTTP server using podman/docker
   - Serves content on http://localhost:8080
   ```bash
   ./utilities/lab-serve
   ```

3. **lab-stop**
   - Stops the local HTTP server
   ```bash
   ./utilities/lab-stop
   ```

4. **lab-clean**
   - Removes the generated site content
   ```bash
   ./utilities/lab-clean
   ```

### Common Workflows

1. **First-time setup**:
   ```bash
   make clean-build  # Clean and build the site
   make serve        # Start the local server
   ```

2. **Development cycle**:
   ```bash
   make run-all     # Build and serve in one command
   # Make your changes
   make build       # Rebuild after changes
   ```

3. **Cleaning up**:
   ```bash
   make stop-clean  # Stop server and clean build directory
   ```

## GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment to GitHub Pages. The workflow (`deploy-pages.yml`) does the following:

1. Triggers on:
   - Pushes to the main branch
   - Manual workflow dispatch

2. Deployment Process:
   - Checks out the repository
   - Sets up the build environment
   - Builds the documentation using Antora
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages

To use GitHub Actions in your fork:

1. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
2. Configure the necessary permissions
3. The workflow will automatically deploy changes pushed to your main branch

## Building and Testing Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker (recommended)
   docker pull ghcr.io/rhpds/showroom-content:latest
   ```

2. Build the documentation:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/showroom/repo \
     --mount 'type=tmpfs,dst=/showroom/repo/.cache' \
     --entrypoint antora \
     -w /showroom/repo \
     ghcr.io/rhpds/showroom-content:latest \
     --to-dir=output default-site.yml
   ```

   Alternatively, use the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. View the built documentation:
   ```bash
   # Using Python's built-in HTTP server
   cd output
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```

   Alternatively, use the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make serve
   ```

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to the original repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your fork and branch
   - Fill out the PR template
