= OpenShift Bare Metal Deployment Workshop

== Introduction

This guide is designed to help you deploy *OpenShift on bare metal* for a variety of workloads, providing flexibility, scalability, and advanced configurations tailored to diverse use cases.

For your convenience, you may optionally *fork this repository* and use it as a *reference guide* when implementing your own bare metal deployments using OpenShift.

This workshop provides a *hands-on experience* with deploying OpenShift 4.16+ on bare metal, enabling participants to configure storage, networking, and optionally integrate advanced features such as *OpenShift Virtualization* or *OpenShift AI*.

*OpenShift* empowers users to deploy and manage containerized workloads with enterprise-grade scalability, robust security, and flexibility across diverse infrastructures.

During this workshop, we will explore common deployment and management activities that platform administrators and infrastructure engineers encounter in their day-to-day workflows.
