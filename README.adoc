= OpenShift 4.18/4.19 Bare Metal Deployment Workshop

== Introduction

This comprehensive workshop provides hands-on experience with deploying *OpenShift 4.18/4.19 on bare metal infrastructure*, covering both connected and disconnected environments. The workshop follows a structured knowledge graph approach, guiding participants through essential concepts, multiple installation methods, and advanced post-deployment configurations.

Built on the *Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)* immutable operating system and *Kubernetes 1.31/1.32* container orchestration, this workshop enables participants to master enterprise-grade OpenShift deployments with advanced storage, networking, and optional features like *OpenShift Virtualization* and *OpenShift AI*.

For your convenience, you may *fork this repository* and use it as a *reference guide* when implementing your own bare metal deployments using OpenShift.

*OpenShift* empowers users to deploy and manage containerized workloads with enterprise-grade scalability, robust security, and flexibility across diverse infrastructures - from connected cloud environments to air-gapped edge deployments.

During this workshop, we will explore common deployment and management activities that platform administrators and infrastructure engineers encounter in their day-to-day workflows, with a focus on practical, production-ready configurations.

== Who Will Benefit Most from Attending This Workshop?

=== Infrastructure Administrators
Those responsible for the day-to-day management of *bare metal infrastructure* and supporting environments for OpenShift.

*Key Responsibilities Include*:

* Provisioning hardware and configuring BIOS, firmware, and network settings
* Ensuring the stability and performance of the underlying infrastructure

=== Platform Engineers
Those responsible for deploying, managing, and scaling OpenShift clusters.

*Key Responsibilities Include*:

* Setting up and configuring OpenShift components like networking, storage, and advanced features
* Integrating OpenShift with existing IT environments and workloads

== Workshop Structure and Learning Path

This workshop follows a *knowledge graph approach* with 7 comprehensive modules, designed to accommodate both connected and disconnected deployment scenarios:

=== Module 1: Introduction - Foundation Concepts
* **Platform Architecture**: Components & benefits of OpenShift 4.18/4.19
* **Installation Methods**: Assisted vs Agent-based installer comparison
* **Workshop Learning Path**: Structured approach to bare metal mastery

=== Module 2: Infrastructure Preparation - Essential Requirements
* **C1: Red Hat Account & Resources** - Pull secrets & tools acquisition
* **C2: Hardware & DNS Planning** - Inventory & network requirements
* **C3: Boot Preparation** - BIOS configuration & discovery methods

=== Installation Method Decision Point
After completing the foundation modules, choose your deployment path based on your environment:

==== Connected Environment Path → Module 3: Assisted Installer
*Cloud-guided Installation with Web-based UI*

* **D1: Red Hat Console Access** - Web-based configuration interface
* **D2: Cluster Configuration** - Network, nodes, and feature settings
* **D3: Discovery ISO Generation** - Custom boot media creation
* **D4: Hardware Discovery** - Automatic detection & validation
* **D5: Installation Monitoring** - Real-time progress tracking

==== Disconnected Environment Path → Module 4: Agent-based Installer
*Air-gapped Installation with CLI-based Approach*

* **E1: install-config.yaml** - Declarative configuration management
* **E2: agent-config.yaml** - Node-specific settings and roles
* **E3: Mirror Registry Setup** - Disconnected image storage
* **E4: Agent ISO Creation** - Self-contained installation media
* **E5: Offline Installation** - Complete air-gapped deployment

=== Module 5: Storage Configuration - OpenShift Data Foundation
* Prepare storage infrastructure for ODF
* Install and configure the Local Storage Operator
* Deploy and configure OpenShift Data Foundation
* Configure the OpenShift Image Registry with ODF backend

=== Module 6: Network Configuration - Advanced Networking
* Secondary networks overview and use cases
* Configuring advanced networks using Nmstate
* Exposing networks through NetworkAttachmentDefinitions
* Production networking best practices

=== Module 7: Optional Features - Advanced Capabilities
* **OpenShift Virtualization**: Managing virtual machines within OpenShift
* **OpenShift AI**: Enabling AI/ML workloads with OpenShift's AI capabilities
* Integration patterns and best practices

== Key Workshop Features

This workshop emphasizes several advanced OpenShift deployment capabilities:

=== Simplified Architecture Benefits
* **No Bootstrap Node Required**: Both installation methods eliminate the need for temporary bootstrap infrastructure
* **Virtual IP Management**: Built-in load balancer functionality without external dependencies
* **Automatic Hardware Discovery**: Intelligent detection and validation of bare metal resources

=== Flexible Deployment Options
* **Standard HA Cluster**: 3 control plane + 2+ worker nodes for production workloads
* **Compact Cluster**: 3 nodes serving dual control plane + worker roles for resource-constrained environments
* **Connected vs Disconnected**: Full support for both internet-connected and air-gapped deployments

=== Enterprise-Grade Foundation
* **Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS**: Immutable, security-hardened operating system
* **Kubernetes 1.31/1.32**: Latest container orchestration with enterprise support
* **Production-Ready Configurations**: Real-world deployment patterns and best practices
