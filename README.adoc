= OpenShift 4.16+ Bare Metal Deployment Workshop

== Introduction

This guide is designed to help you deploy *OpenShift on bare metal* for a variety of workloads, providing flexibility, scalability, and advanced configurations tailored to diverse use cases.

For your convenience, you may optionally *fork this repository* and use it as a *reference guide* when implementing your own bare metal deployments using OpenShift.

This workshop provides a *hands-on experience* with deploying OpenShift 4.16+ on bare metal, enabling participants to configure storage, networking, and optionally integrate advanced features such as *OpenShift Virtualization* or *OpenShift AI*.

*OpenShift 4.16+* empowers users to deploy and manage containerized workloads with enterprise-grade scalability, robust security, and flexibility across diverse infrastructures.

During this workshop, we will explore common deployment and management activities that platform administrators and infrastructure engineers encounter in their day-to-day workflows.

== Who Will Benefit Most from Attending This Workshop?

=== Infrastructure Administrators
Those responsible for the day-to-day management of *bare metal infrastructure* and supporting environments for OpenShift.

*Key Responsibilities Include*:

* Provisioning hardware and configuring BIOS, firmware, and network settings
* Ensuring the stability and performance of the underlying infrastructure

=== Platform Engineers
Those responsible for deploying, managing, and scaling OpenShift clusters.

*Key Responsibilities Include*:

* Setting up and configuring OpenShift components like networking, storage, and advanced features
* Integrating OpenShift with existing IT environments and workloads

== What Content Is Covered in This Workshop?

This workshop is organized into *6 main sections*:

=== 1. Introduction to OpenShift 4.16+
* Overview of OpenShift and its features for bare metal deployments
* Key benefits of OpenShift for modern workloads

=== 2. Preparing Bare Metal Infrastructure
* Hardware prerequisites: Control plane, worker nodes, and network requirements
* Setting up BIOS/firmware, PXE boot, and provisioning nodes

=== 3. Networking Configuration
* Configuring VLANs, DNS, and load balancers for high availability
* Ensuring proper routing and ingress for applications

=== 4. Storage Configuration
* Setting up OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) or external storage systems
* Configuring dynamic provisioning for persistent storage

=== 5. Deploying OpenShift 4.16+
* Step-by-step guide using the *Assisted Installer* or *Agent-based Installer*:
** *Assisted Installer*: Simplifies cluster installation with an intuitive web interface
** *Agent-based Installer*: Provides flexibility for disconnected or custom bare metal environments
* Setting up control plane and worker nodes

=== 6. Optional Features
* *OpenShift Virtualization*: Managing virtual machines within OpenShift
* *OpenShift AI*: Enabling AI/ML workloads with OpenShift's AI capabilities
